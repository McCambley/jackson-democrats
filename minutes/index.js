### 1. Voting and Election Rules

The group reviewed new voting rules, using a handout provided by Meredith that includes a QR code linking to a New Hampshire voter registration guide. Key points of the discussion included:

- New residents can register with the town clerk.
- **Same-day voter registration** is still available.
- There is no affidavit option for voters this year; consensus was that those without proper documentation will be turned away.
- Concern was raised that the new rules could lead to voter disenfranchisement.
- A **passport** can prove identity, age, and citizenship but not domicile, while a **Real ID** can prove domicile but not citizenship.
- The group plans to contact the Pope Library about attending a passport event hosted by Representative Pappas. If that is not possible, they will ask Maggie Goodlander to host a similar event.
- **Ashley** suggested putting up flyers to encourage residents to check their voter registration and bring the correct documents to the polls, especially in light of reports of voter lists being purged in other states.
- **Chris** mentioned that the voter checklist could be published in the eNews if all partisan language is removed.
- The **voter protection hotline** was promoted as a way for people to learn about voting laws and volunteer from home on election day.
